Loom Game Engine

GETTING STARTED

Loom requires CMake 2.8.9 and Rake.

To install CMake, visit <http://cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html>.

Download and install the CMake distribution for your platform.

To install Rake, first install Ruby. On OSX, it is already installed. On
Windows, you can use <http://rubyinstaller.org/>. 

After Ruby is installed, run gem install rake to get rake on your path.

After that, please see specific README file for your toolchain/platform.

Run loom docs via Loom CLI to see the latest docs, or run rake generate:docs 
and look in docs/output/html/index.html to generate them yourself. The docs
cover both native and script development.
