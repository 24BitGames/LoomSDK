### Loom Native SDK - Mobile App and Game Development

Welcome to the Loom Native SDK!  This repository contains the full source code of the Loom mobile technology.  

The Loom development team is actively building Loom, right here, with the work available in [Loom Turbo](http://www.loomsdk.com/plans)'s firehose builds within minutes!  

### [Loom Turbo](http://www.loomsdk.com/plans) 

We realize not everyone is an experienced C/C++ programmer with working native toolchains and a need to extend Loom at a low level.  We also use Loom to create applications, so we built Loom Turbo.

##### If you're interested in accelerated development using industry standard scripting and amazing live reload workflow, you want [Loom Turbo](http://www.loomsdk.com/plans).

### Platforms

Loom currently runs on Android, iOS, Windows, OSX, Linux, and Ouya
